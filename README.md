# Classification-Algos
This repository contains implementations of four classification algorithms applied to a dataset. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate google collab file, along with detailed explanations and visualizations.
# Introduction <br>
This repository demonstrates the use of various classification algorithms on a given dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
<br>
# Algorithms <br>
The following classification algorithms are included:

1) Logistic Regression - logistic_regression.ipynb <br>
2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) - svm.ipynb <br>
3) Decision Tree  - decision_tree_classification.ipynb <br>
4) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - KNN Classification.ipynb <br>
5) Naive Bayes - Naive_Bayes.ipynb <br>
6) Kernel SVM - Kernel_Svm.iynb <br>
7) Random forest Classification - Random_forest_classification.ipynb <br>
<br>
<h1>Dataset</h1> <br>
The dataset used for training and testing the models is included in the repository as dataset.csv. It contains several features and a target variable for classification. The data preprocessing steps are included in each notebook.
<br>
<h1>Results</h1> <br>
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using the Confusion Matrix.
<br>
<h1>Requirements</h1> <br>
To run the notebooks, you will need the following libraries: <br>
1. Python 3.x <br>
2. collab notebook <br>
3. Pandas <br>
4. NumPy <br>
5. Scikit-learn <br>
6. Matplotlib <br>
